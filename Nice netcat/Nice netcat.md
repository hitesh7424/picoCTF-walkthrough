## Description

There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: $ nc mercury.picoctf.net 22902, but it doesn't speak English...

## Hints

1. You can practice using netcat with this picoGym problem: [what's a netcat?](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/34)
2. You can practice reading and writing ASCII with this picoGym problem: [Let's Warm Up](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/22)
