# It is my Birthday


## Description

I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website. http://mercury.picoctf.net:50970/ 


## Hints

1.  Look at the category of this problem.
2.  How may a PHP site check the rules in the description?


## Approach

This CTF was based on that the two files can have same MD5 hash (MD5 collision)

I have to search 2 file which generates same md5 hash
